# What it is

Euromax is a collection of Max/MSP bPatchers inspired by Eurorack modules. 
They vary from creative clock sources to wild-sounding oscillators. 
They are easily added to your patches through a right-click menu.

+ All Euromax patches are created with basic Max/MSP objects. This ensures cross-platform compatibility, and no extra externals need to be downloaded.
+ The patches can be easily explored for learning or for modification. All patches come with detailed help files.
+ These patches will be frequently updated, as these were made for my own use as well. Updates will not break old patches, as every module added to your own patches is completely saved with the patch.
